        <h2>Countries</h2>
        <p>
          In South American continent there are a lot of beautiful countries
          with amazing cities and sightseeings to discover around, such as
          Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, Chile and others.

        <h2>Best places to visit</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Iguazu Falls</h3>
            <p>
              Located in northern Argentina, where it straddles the border with
              Brazil, Iguazu ranks high among the world's biggest waterfalls.
              Measuring 197-269 feet tall, 1.7 miles wide, with 275 drops and an
              average flow rate of 62,010 cubic feet per second, this is truly a
              South American bucket list spectacle to behold. They're surrounded
              by the lush rainforest of Iguazu National Park, a subtropical
              paradise that is home to more than 2,000 species of vascular
              plants and abundant wildlife such as tapirs, howler monkeys, and
              jaguars.
            </p>

          <li>
            <h3>Lake Titicaca</h3>
            <p>
              Straddling the border between Bolivia and Peru, Lake Titicaca is
              the world's highest navigable lake (at an elevation of 12,338
              feet). The area has been inhabited by indigenous cultures for
              centuries, making visiting it one of the best things to do in
              Bolivia if you want to learn more about its people. Start in the
              town of Copacabana, from which you can reserve a tour of the lake
              or jump on a boat to Isla del Sol or Isla de la Luna. Once you
              arrive at either island, it's easy to book a homestay with local
              families.

            <h3>Brazil Amazon</h3>
            <p>
              Although 20% of the Amazon Rainforest has been cut down in the
              last 40 years, what remains is about the same size as the lower 48
              US states and accounts for half the planet's tropical forest.
              About two-thirds of the 3 million square mile Amazon Basin is in
              Brazil. It's among the world's most biodiverse places, with around
              16,000 different species of trees, 2,000 species of fish, 1,300
              species of birds, over 400 species of mammals, nearly 400 species
              of reptiles, and 2.5 million kinds of insects. If you go, bug
              repellant is a must!

        <h2>Local cuisine</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Ceviche (Peru)</h3>
            <p>
              Like many of the foods on this list, ceviche is claimed to have
              been 'invented' in several South American countries and, nowadays,
              is a recognised staple in Peru, Ecuador and Mexico. Although all
              three certainly serve up delicious versions, there's no doubt that
              Peru is the one nation that's most linked to the dish. What is
              ceviche, you ask? That'll be raw fish marinated in lime juice and
              spices, mixed in with an abundance of coriander and chilli and
              usually served with steamed sweet potato or corn, which dulls the
              sharpness of the chilli and rounds off the taste impeccably well.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Empanada (Argentina and Chile)</h3>
            <p>
              Here's another South America food that's incredibly famous and
              that can vary dramatically depending on where you try it. The
              empanada, which literally translates to "wrapped in bread", is the
              most popular street-food and snack in the entire continent and can
              be filled with either savoury or sweet ingredients and then is
              either fried or baked. Everything about the empanada varies from
              country to country: not only the filling but also the size, the
              cooking method and even the name. Unlike ceviche, which is
              basically the same meal whether you have it in Peru or Ecuador,
              empanadas in South America can vary wildly so comparing them is
              nearly impossible.

            <h3>Salte単a (Bolivia)</h3>
            <p>
              Salte単a is Bolivia's answer to the empanada although it is
              different in so many ways that it deserves its own entry on this
              list. Salte単as are our go-to dinner when we're in La Paz,
              especially after a full day of explorations. A Bolivian salte単a,
              filled to the brim with meat and vegetables like peas and carrots,
              all cooked in a delicious sauce, is a bonafide meal-in-one -
              especially at high altitude where big meals are overwhelming to
              digestion.
